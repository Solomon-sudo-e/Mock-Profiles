# Mock-Profiles

This is my first project using Springboot. I plan to update it more as I go!


The goal of the project would be to make a full scale social media website 
using various different tools to learn each and everyone I can.

Currently the goal next is as follows :

- Create password encryption for both USERS and PROFILES
- Create a pending, accepted, denied friend request. Also notifications for said friend request.
- Use Kafka in order to make a real time messaging system that also updates various things like:
          Status
          Likes
          Comments
          Post
- With that being said, I do plan to create a "timeline" of post going in order of most relevent
  to the user, to least relavant and also use the time at which it was posted to base what should show up
  on the time line.

- The next big thing I plan to do before any of this is largely test what I already have to make sure that everything
  will work in the future EXACTLY as intended.
